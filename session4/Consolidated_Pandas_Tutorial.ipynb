    "Pandas was created by Wes McKinney in 2008, and is an open source project under a very permissive license. As an open source project it's got a strong community, with over one hundred software developers all committing code to help make it better. Before pandas existed we had only a hodge podge of tools to use, such as numpy, the python core libraries, and some python statistical tools. But pandas has quickly become the defacto library for representing relational data for data scientists.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2012 Wes McKinney wrote the definitive Pandas reference book called Python for Data Analysis and published by O'Reilly, and it's recently been update to a second edition. I consider this the go to book for understanding how Pandas works. I also appreciate the more brief book \"Learning the Pandas Library\" by Matt Harrison. It's not a comprehensive book on data analysis and statistics. But if you just want to learn the basics of Pandas and want to do so quickly, I think it's a well laid out volume and it can be had for a good price."
